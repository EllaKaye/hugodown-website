summary: How I set up my PhD as an R package.
abstract: "In this talk, I will try to convince you that if you have any of your own data or write any of your own R functions, then you should put them into an R package. Benefits include reproducibility and keeping everything together and accessible. Also, itâ€™s really easy to do, and to prove it, I will build a package from scratch before your very eyes. I will also introduce the `bookdown` package for writing reports and even your thesis. Filled with tips and tricks from my own experiences, this talk could save you hours!"
